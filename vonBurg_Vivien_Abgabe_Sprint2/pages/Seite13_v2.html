        Two women pioneers in physics and mathematics are celebrated in this issue. Both were able

        Voltaire described Émilie du Châtelet as a “great man whose only fault was being a woman”. 
        A French aristocrat, she has largely been remembered for being Voltaire's mistress, 
        although Voltaire regarded her as a genius in her own right. Together they wrote a book 
        on Newton's philosophy (only Voltaire's name appeared on the title page). In reality du 
        Châtelet explained Newton's mathematics to Voltaire. He told a friend “she dictated and I wrote”.
        Du Châtelet's most important work was translating Newton's treatise on gravity into French 
        from the original Latin. In so doing, she explained Newton's mathematics in prose, translated 
        his geometry into calculus and described the latest Newtonian research. The work is still 
        considered the standard French translation.</div>

    On Pluto, where the average
    temperature is around -230°C, water
    would be frozen too hard to flow, but that
    is not the case for these frozen gases.
    “This is not an ancient landscape,”
    says John Spencer, a planetary scientist
    from the Southwest Research Institute in
    Boulder, Colorado. “We think it has to be
    less than 100 million years old” – a blink
    of an eye, in geological terms.<br/>
    How a cold, tiny world such as Pluto
    can have been recently geologically active
    – let alone active enough to form a smooth
    new crust over much of its surface and
    produce mountains comparable in height
    to some of the Earth's great ranges –
    is baffling.</div></div></div>

        Stunning images beamed back to Earth
        by New Horizons have enhanced Pluto's
        mystique. By RICHARD A LOVETT.

        As recently as June, Pluto was one of the
        most mysterious objects in the Solar System
        – so remote scientists weren't even sure
        of its size. Today, we not only have a clear
        measure of its diameter (2,370 kilometres,
        give or take 20 kilometres), but we know
        it has a red-streaked polar cap.
